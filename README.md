# CS 32 Project: Lofi Maker

(no project partners)
I intend to create a lofi music maker. In particular, the user needs to input a selection of samples (which needs to include one musical sample/song but can include dialogue, noises, etc.) and select from a limited set of options (about speed, beat type, etc.). The user then gets a mixed lofi track created from their input.
